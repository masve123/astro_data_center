                    For hourly rentals in the US via our instant deployment portal, access to the server 
                    is typically granted within seconds, although it can occasionally take up to 4 minutes.

                <p class="pb-6 text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                    For other locations or for monthly rentals, access is usually provided within 1 hour during 
                    our business hours of Monday to Saturday, 7am-10pm EST. In some instances, it could take up 
                    to 24 hours, and if so, our technical team will email you promptly to keep you informed.

                When your server rental period is over, we’ll be shutting down your VM and wiping any images you've 
                used clean. This means all your data will be gone for good. So please, make sure you've saved everything 
                you need somewhere else before you ask us to cancel your server. We can't keep copies, and SnowCell won't 
                be able to help with lost data after you've told us to end the service.
